Intellectual Property & Clean Room Policy
===

To ensure the long-term viability of Mosaico as an Open Source project, we strictly enforce a "Clean Room" contribution policy. We operate in the Robotics & Physical AI domain, where proprietary trade secrets and patents are common; therefore, we must be rigorous about the origin of every line of code. To protect the integrity of the project's critical sections, certain contributors may be asked to execute a formal affidavit confirming their code is unencumbered and authorized for open-source distribution.

**By submitting a Pull Request, you certify that:**

1. **No NDA Encumbrances:** The code, algorithms, and logic you are contributing are **not** covered by any Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), employment contract, or confidentiality agreement with a current or former employer.
2. **Public Domain / Open Standard:** Any complex algorithm implemented must be based on publicly available research, whitepapers, or standard documentation. You must not implement proprietary logic based on internal knowledge of closed-source systems.
    * *Requirement:* If you implement a specific paper or standard, you **must cite the public source** in the PR description and code comments.


3. **Originality:** The code is your original work or is derived from a source with a compatible Open Source license (which you must verify and cite).
4. **No Patented Logic:** You are not knowingly implementing algorithms protected by active patents that would impinge on the project's ability to remain free and open.

### Compliance Checklist
We take intellectual property rights seriously. Violations will result in the immediate rejection of the PR and a potential ban from future contributions.

* ⛔ **NO Proprietary Algorithms:** Do not commit code that implements trade secrets.
* ⛔ **NO NDA Material:** Never use or reference material obtained under a confidential disclosure.
* ⛔ **NO Copy-Pasting:** Do not copy code from proprietary codebases or incompatible open-source projects without explicit permission.
* ✅ **Public References:** Always link to public documentation for non-trivial logic.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> If you are unsure whether a specific implementation violates your employment agreement or an NDA, **do not submit it**.
